# Take a look at the SELECT statement.
# Since we are using two tables, fields in the SELECT statement must adhere
# to the following format: table_name.column_name (i.e., population.city ).
# In addition, to eliminate duplicates, as both tables include the city name,
# we used the WHERE clause as seen above.
# finally organize the outputted results and clean up the code so itâ€™s more compact
